Input phone number and message and click submit.

The meat of the example code is in src/main/scala/MyScalatraFilter.scala

get("/") display a form for sending sms
post("/send") uses Tropo session token to send the sms.

You will need to create a Tropo scripting application with a messaging token.
Replace the value of token to your own.
Your Tropo script should at least contain this line: message $msg, { :to => 'tel:+' + $to, :network => 'SMS'}
